# Introduction
This is a React web application that allows users to manage and view their recent bank transactions. Users can view a table of all transactions, add new transactions, and search for specific transactions based on description. The application fetches data from a local server running JSON DB server.

# Project Setup
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Create a `db.json` file in the project directory with data in it.
3. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install`.
4. Start the local server by running `json-server --watch db.json`.

# Core Deliverables
 * See a table of all transactions.
 * Fill out and submit the form to add a new transaction. This should add the new transaction to the table *the new transaction does not have to be persisted to the backend*
* Filter transactions by typing into the search bar. Only transactions with a description matching the search term should be shown in the transactions table.

 # Usage

2. The main page will display a table of all transactions.
3. To add a new transaction, fill out the form in the "Add Transaction" section and click the "Add Transaction" button.
